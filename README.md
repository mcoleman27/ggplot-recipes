# ggplot-recipes

Every so often I have to make plots for whatever reason. Typically these plots are very simple to make, but occasionally I have to do something that's complex enough that a google search is required.
A few months later I am required to make a plot that I needed to google search to learn how to make, but as I only do it once in a blue moon, I forgot how to do it and had to google again.
This sucks, so I made a repository to keep all these things in. Hopefully others will find it useful and be able to contribute

# Current "recipes"

## [Histograms](https://github.com/mcoleman27/ggplot-recipes/blob/main/Plotting%20Examples/Histograms/histograms.md)
Rescaling axis, shuffling bins sideways and advanced binwidth generation.

# Extra info
If you want to contribute recipes to the knowledge base, feel free to raise an issue or make a pull request. Please endeavour to make your plots using default R datasets, such as iris!

All pages are generated using R markdown, it's pretty cool I guess.
